# ShellScripts
Scripts I've accumulated or generated over time for a variety of purposes. Shell scripts include, but are not limited to:
- UNIX-based Shells (macOS and Linux, sometimes Windows) (csh, tcsh, bash, zsh, sh, etc.)
- Windows Shell (cmd, PowerShell)
- Cross-platform Shells (PowerShell Core)
