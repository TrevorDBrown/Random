# AGC

A silly, dysfunctional, unfaithful Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC)/Display-Keyboard (DSKY) app, written in VB.NET. I began working on this after I became interested in the AGC, Apollo missions, and space in general. I loved the idea of the Verb/Noun interface, so I was tinkering with that idea with this app.

This will in no way become a fully fledged AGC emulator. Here's some great websites/projects doing such work:

VirtualAGC - [GitHub Repostiory](https://github.com/virtualagc/virtualagc) - [Website](https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo)\
Moonjs - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/siravan/moonjs) - [Website](https://svtsim.com/moonjs/agc.html)
